So there I was, sitting in the Flughafen.
The Klimaanlage was broken and I was sweating bullets.
Not to mention the Musik in the terminal was driving me crazy.
Rammstein is just not a band I can get into.
I had to get to Berlin by morning, and there was only one option left, but I wasn't sure I liked it.
I hate BMW's, but it was the only car available.  
I stopped by the Baeckerei on my way.  
I needed my favorite Gebaeck to calm my nerves.  
Riding a sugar high, I pulled onto the Autobahn, but this car was a Hund - I was doing 100 in the slow lane, and I knew I'd have to find another gear.  
Even at my rate of speed I was still going to be late, I should have gotten a Porsche.
I finally reached the exit, and I merged onto the Hauptstrasse.
The Schloss was just a few more blocks down the road.
Hopefully I didn't miss the most delicious Bratwurst in the country.
And then it happened, the cat bolted out of the ratskeller, I swerved, I hit the curb, and flipped my car upon it hood, laying at a rest on the sidewalk.
When I woke up I was sitting in a Biergarten in Raesfeld surrounded by girls in Dirndels.  That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
At least until all those girls turned into draches and ate me.
Luckily they didn't, they were so wettbewerbsfaehig about who was the scariest I was able to escape.  I continued on my way in a Porsche I acquired.
